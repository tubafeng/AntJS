this proj is for the test of my js toolkit "Ant"
It does the following job hopfully 
  1. provide a browser independent interface for 
      a. dom operation
      b. css manupilation
      c. event system
      d. ajax interface
      e. css transform/transition interface
      f. UI framework
  2. a few test project for utilies the functions provided by job 1
      a. a image viewer
      b. a nav framework 
      c. a content management client-side tool 

for now , the job 1 , has lots of dup ground to jQuery, i guss those will be removed from my tools 
but, the propose of this project is differ from jQuert, so the question is can I summerize out high level interfaces built on jQuery ?
